PDF to Audiobook ([download at GitHub](https://github.com/jbc50/article_audiobook))
-This code is my quick attempt to scrape and format text from academic articles to be read as an audio book txt file
-The code works for AEJ articles and NBER articles, but does a decent job more generally
-It removes footnotes, line spacing, citations, headers and in-text tables
